# Problem
Read the problem statement here: [Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-ii/description/)

# My logic

- As constraints are large, we need to thing about the optimal algorithm Dijkstra's Algo will not work here.
- If you look closely, the given graph is just like a linked list, where we have to find the distance from head to tail.
- And on each query, we add a new edge, now add an edge in the `range(left, right)` is equivalent to removing all nodes in `[left + 1, left + 2, left +3, ...., right -1]`.
- So on each step, we will try to remove the edge and get the answer as the length of the list.

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        set<int> edges;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            edges.insert(i);
        }

        vector<int> ans;
        
        for (const auto& i : queries) {
            auto lb = edges.lower_bound(i[0] + 1);
            auto ub = edges.upper_bound(i[1] - 1);
            edges.erase(lb, ub);
            ans.push_back(edges.size());
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
