# Problem
Read the problem statement here: [Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-numbers-which-are-not-special/description/)

# My logic

- For any number x, all positive divisors of x except x are called the proper divisors of x. A number is special if it has `exactly 2 proper divisors`.
- We can take the hint from this statement:
- Think which number has `exactly 1 proper divisor`? The answer is prime numbers are the only numbers that have only 1 proper divisor because any prime number can have only 2 divisors, 1 & the number itself. So only 1 proper divisor i.e. 1.
- Now the only numbers that will possibly have `exactly 2 proper divisors` will be the squares of the prime number. Why? Because the proper divisors of a prime number 
`p`, squared are just 1 and `p`, which totals to 2 proper divisors.

        vector<bool> sieve(size + 1, true);
        sieve[0] = false; // 0 is not a prime number
        sieve[1] = false; // 1 is not a prime number

        // Apply the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
        for (int p = 2; p * p <= size; ++p) {
            if (sieve[p]) {
                for (int multiple = p * p; multiple <= size; multiple += p) {
                    sieve[multiple] = false; // Mark multiples of p as non-prime
                }
            }

        return sieve;

        vector<bool> sieve = generateSieve(upperLimit);

        // Count how many squares of primes are in the range [l, r]
        ll countSpecialNumbers = 0;
        for (int p = 2; p <= upperLimit; ++p) {
            if (sieve[p]) {
                ll primeSquare = static_cast<ll>(p) * p;
                if (primeSquare > r) {
                    break; // No need to check further if prime squares exceed r
                }
                if (primeSquare >= l) {
                    ++countSpecialNumbers; // Increment count if the square is within [l, r]
